# PyGame Setup
The purpose of this game is to demonstrate how you can refactor a huge python script into simple small modules which are readable and understandable.

## Getting it to work
1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/Dihfahsih1/PyGame.git`

2. After cloning, change working directory using `cd PyGame`

3. Create the virtual environment using `python -m venv virtual_env_name`

4. Activate the virtual environment using `virtual_env_name\Scripts\activate`

5. Install the pygame library using `pip install pygame`

6. Now you can run the game by typing `python game.py` on your terminal

The above are based on the assumptions that you are using `windows OS` and have `python3` insttalled
